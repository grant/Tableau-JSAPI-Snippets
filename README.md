Tableau-JSAPI-Snippets
======================

Sublime snippets for Tableau's javascript API

Reference: http://onlinehelp.tableausoftware.com/v0.0/server/en-us/js_api.htm

Prepared for TCC 2013

This is updated up to Tableau JSAPI v8.

Install
-------
Use git to install the snippets with the following commands:

*MacOSX*

    `git clone git://github.com/granttimmerman/Tableau-JSAPI-Snippets.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/Nodejs`

*Windows*

    `git clone https://github.com/granttimmerman/Tableau-JSAPI-Snippets "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\Nodejs"`


Remember
--------
* Disable this snippet pack when not in use (and enable when in use). It is quite verbose and will disrupt normal javascript work that doesn't not deal with the API. You can disable/enable packages via Tools > Command Pallete > 'Enable Package' | 'Disable Package'

Contribute
----------
Not all the snippets are fully complete and not all the functionality of Tableau's JSAPI is documented here. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to send me a pull request. Remember to update both completion files (the ones with and without comments) concurrently and make sure they are sync'd.
